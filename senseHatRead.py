* This program is created for Assignment 1 of Programming Internet of Things -  Course Master of IT - RMIT University.
* This code has parts which are inspired by the course material of  - Programming Internet of Things  - RMIT University.
*
* The purpose of the Program is to read the senseHat Data (Temperature, Humidity and Pressure)
* of a RaspberryPi and send to a Database and PushBullet.
* For more information please see: https://github.com/kokaruk/IOT-A1
* This Module returns the reading of sensor data for usage in the program.
* There are two Parameters by default asString is 'y' for getting the reading as String with Unit
* or 'n' for only as float
* Further more sensorType reads by default t for temperature - calculated to account for the heat from the CPU
*    rt = regular temperature (without any calculations)
*    p = pressure
*    h = humidity
*    pt = temperature from pressure chip
*    ht = temperature from humidity chip
*    c = CPU Temperature
